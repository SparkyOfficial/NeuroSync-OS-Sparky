# NeuroSync OS Sparky

An experimental microkernel for synchronizing processes and AI modules that works like neurons with signal-based communication.

## Overview

NeuroSync OS Sparky is a cutting-edge microkernel designed to manage threads and tasks as "neurons" that exchange signals like a nervous system. This innovative approach allows for highly efficient and biologically-inspired process management.

## Key Features

- **Neuron-based Architecture** - Processes and threads modeled as neurons
- **Signal-based Communication** - Neurons communicate through signals via synapses
- **Microkernel Design** - Minimal core with modular extensions
- **Advanced Scheduling** - Multiple scheduling algorithms (Priority-Based, Round Robin, Weighted Fair Queuing)
- **Memory Management** - Custom memory pools and garbage collection
- **Priority Messaging** - Priority-based message queues for critical communications
- **Weighted Connections** - Synaptic connections with configurable weights
- **Thread Safety** - Fully thread-safe operations for concurrent processing

## Architecture

The system is organized into several core modules:

1. **Core** - Central scheduling and system management
2. **Neuron** - Neuron lifecycle and management
3. **Synapse** - Communication pathways between neurons
4. **Memory** - Advanced memory management with pools and garbage collection
5. **Diagnostics** - System monitoring and profiling
6. **API** - Public interfaces for neuron manipulation

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites
